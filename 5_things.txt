Credit history and score: Lenders use credit history and credit score to determine a borrower's creditworthiness and their ability to repay the loan. A strong credit history and a high credit score may make it easier to qualify for a loan and result in better terms and interest rates.

Income and employment: Lenders will consider a borrower's income and employment status when determining their ability to repay the loan. A stable income and a steady employment history may make it easier to qualify for a loan.

Collateral: Some types of loans, such as secured loans, require the borrower to provide collateral, such as a property or a vehicle. The value and condition of the collateral will be considered by the lender.

Purpose of the loan: Lenders may have specific requirements or restrictions on the use of loan proceeds. It's important to understand the lender's guidelines and ensure that the loan will be used for an eligible purpose.

Repayment ability: Lenders will evaluate a borrower's ability to repay the loan. This includes their debt-to-income ratio and their current financial obligations. It's important to have a realistic plan for repaying the loan and to be able to demonstrate this to the lender.
